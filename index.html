        <h1>Nandika Taneja</h1>
        <p>I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science from Arizona State University, and I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Engineering from GGSIPU.<br>
            With over a year of hands-on experience as a software engineer at a mid-sized B2B e-commerce company, I've had the chance to dive into some exciting projects! Here my responsibilities revolved around data engineering, building software solutions by harnessing the power of Generative AI and cloud technologies to help my organization achieve operational efficiency.<br>
            Apart from this I had the opportunity to do multiple internships, In these roles, I focused on developing web applications and machine learning models, allowing me to refine my skills and gain practical insights that I aim to bring to future projects and collaborations.
